# RockFall
My first game made in python using pygame 

This game is a 2D game where the player moves a construction worker to avoid the falling rocks from the cliff. The highest score gets saved and players can compete to beat the highscore.

To run download and open RockFall_Main.py then run module.

Works on Mac and Windows
